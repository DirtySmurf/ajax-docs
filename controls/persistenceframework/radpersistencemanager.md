# RadPersistenceManager

**RadPersistenceManager** is the main control from Telerik Persistence Framework. **RadPersistenceManager** provides centralized configuration point for Telerik controls' state persistence.

The main features of **RadPersistenceManager** are:

* Define visually and codeless (in Visual Studio design-time) Telerik controls which state should be persisted.
* No need to modify your application logic.
* No need to write JavaScript to restore controls client state.

>caution Note that you cannot have more than one **RadPersistenceManager** in a singe page. In case of **MasterPage** and / or **WebUserControl**, the best option is to use **RadPersistenceManager** on the master/main page and use [RadPersistenceManagerProxy]({%slug persistenceframework/radpersistencemanagerproxy%}) in the **ContentPage** / **WebUserControl**.

## Configure state persistence in Configuration Wizard

**RadPersistenceManager** comes with a visual builder for setting up the controls that should be persisted. You can access the Configuration Wizard from the **SmartTag** for  **RadPersistenceManager**. The Wizard's dialog will contain a list of the supported Telerik controls that present in the same **NamingContainer** as the **RadPersistenceManager** and you can easily select specific control(s) for persistence.

## Configure state persistence in the markup

Declaratively you can define **PersistenceSetting** by **ControlId** defining single control to be persisted.

````ASP.NET
<telerik:RadPersistenceManager ID="RadPersistenceManager1" runat="server">
	<PersistenceSettings>
		<telerik:PersistenceSetting ControlID="RadTreeView1" />
	</PersistenceSettings>
</telerik:RadPersistenceManager>
````

## Configure state persistence in the code behind

In code-behind you can add persistence settings to define controls in three different ways:

* Define **PersistenceSetting** by control's **ID** - define single control for persistence

````C#
//add setting by control's ID
RadPersistenceManager1.PersistenceSettings.AddSetting("RadTreeView1");
````
````VB
'add setting by control's ID
RadPersistenceManager1.PersistenceSettings.AddSetting("RadTreeView1")
````

* Define **PersistenceSetting** by control's instance - define single control for persistence

````C#
//add setting by control's instance
RadPersistenceManager1.PersistenceSettings.AddSetting(RadTreeView1);
````
````VB
'add setting by control's instance
RadPersistenceManager1.PersistenceSettings.AddSetting(RadTreeView1)
````

* Define **PersistenceSetting** by control's type - define all controls of specific type for persistence

````C#
//add setting by control's type
RadPersistenceManager1.PersistenceSettings.AddSetting(typeof(RadTreeView));
````
````VB
'add setting by control's type
RadPersistenceManager1.PersistenceSettings.AddSetting(GetType(RadTreeView))
````
